# Secret Tender

This platform is designed to facilitate secure and confidential tender processes for Web3 projects seeking auditing services. By doing the process on-chain, we ensure transparency and fairness for both project owners and auditing firms.

This platform allows Web3 projects to:

- Create confidential tenders for auditing their projects.
- Receive proposals from multiple auditing firms with details on cost, time, and conditions.
- Make informed decisions based on real data, including past performance and history of the auditing firms.

For auditing firms, the platform:

- Provides an opportunity to submit proposals directly to any Web3 project.
- Ensures a fair and transparent process where the best proposal (chosen by the tender's project) wins.

Key Features

- Secure and Confidential: All tenders and proposals are encrypted to ensure confidentiality and fairness. They are only visible to the project owners after the tender is closed. In this way other auditing firms cannot copy the proposals of their competitors.
- Transparency: Projects can view past performance data of auditing firms.
- Fair Competition: Auditing firms can submit proposals directly to projects without intermediaries.
- On-chain: Ensures the integrity and immutability of the tender process.
