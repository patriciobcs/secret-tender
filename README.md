# Secret Tender
Create Private Onchain Proposal

> Built at ethGlobal Brussels 2024 <

This platform is designed to facilitate secure and confidential tender processes for Web3 projects and DAOs. By doing the process on-chain, we ensure transparency and fairness for both project owners and RFQ responder. Protect the Competitiveness and the IP of your company. Don't disclose your strategy, research and pricing strategy to your competitors.

This platform allows Web3 projects to:

- Create confidential tenders for auditing their projects.
- Receive proposals from multiple auditing firms with details on cost, time, and conditions.
- Make informed decisions based on real data, including past performance and history of the auditing firms.

For auditing firms, the platform:

- Provides an opportunity to submit proposals directly to any Web3 project.
- Ensures a fair and transparent process where the best proposal (chosen by the tender's project) wins.

Key Features

- Secure and Confidential: All tenders and proposals are encrypted to ensure confidentiality and fairness. They are only visible to the project owners after the tender is closed. In this way other auditing firms cannot copy the proposals of their competitors.
- Transparency: Projects can view past performance data of auditing firms.
- Fair Competition: Auditing firms can submit proposals directly to projects without intermediaries.
- On-chain: Ensures the integrity and immutability of the tender process.
